# Unique-Substring-Operation

The task is to transform a given string, which consists of only lowercase letters, into a new string by replacing some characters with '#' symbols. The goal is to minimize the number of '#' symbols used in such a way that no substring of size K in the new string contains any duplicate characters. In other words, we need to ensure that within any substring of length K, all characters are unique, and we want to do this with the fewest possible character replacements.

The minimum number of operations required such that no substring of size K contains duplicates should be displayed.
